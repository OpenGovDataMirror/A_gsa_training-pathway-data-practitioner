# Open Source Software and Version Control

## About this class

The class discusses two related topics of open source softare and version control.  Furthermore, it provides the overview of the federal source code policy, what GSA is doing to implement the policy, and how the agency and public benefit.  From a hands-on perspective, it provides opportunities for students to work with an open source project in one code repository to make changes to the code, submit the changes, and provide comments (and issues). This is a beginner friendly class for someone who has little to no experience with GitHub.

## Pre-class requirements

You will need:

* [a GitHub account configured to GSA standards](#setup) - we will walk through GitHub account creation at the beginning of class but, to save time, please create an account beforehand
* a general understanding of federal and [GSA open source software](https://github.com/GSA/open-source-policy)

## What we will do

We will cover the following:

1. Federal and GSA open source software policy - what it is and how it is implemented
2. Conduct a "hands-on" exercise with an open source project - edit code, submit code via a pull request, review code, comment on code, and create project issues
