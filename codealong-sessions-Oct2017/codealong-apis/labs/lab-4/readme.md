3. Use the Swagger documentation to find out if this is a valid URL: https://twitter.com/4fwcc

4. Find the API endpoint that can be used to get a count of government accounts for a social media platform.

5. Use the Swagger documentation to find out:
- Which Social Media Platform has the most official accounts.
- What are the number of accounts on the top 3 social media platforms?
- What is the source of this data?

### Research Government Jobs

1. From the API directory, select the API that has information about government jobs.

2. What endpoint would you use to get a listing of IT jobs?

3. What is the URL for one specific IT job?

4. What other APIs are available for this information, according to the documentation?

### Find out about Sustainable Facilities

2. Find the endpoint that provides contract language related to procurement clauses.

3. Using this endpoint, how many clauses are available that are related to "Electrical Contractors and Other Wiring Installation Contractors"? (Hint: you may need to do some Internet sluething to find the NAICS code that matches that.)
